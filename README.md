# VFB scRNAseq Ontology

The VFB scRNAseq ontology contain scRNAseq data to be loaded into VFB.

This information is taken from [FlyBase](https://flybase.org/), which sources it from the [EMBL-EBI Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home), which compiles scRNAseq data from multiple sources.

The gene expression data cannot be stored on this repo due to size, but can be generated by using the [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit) by running `sh run.sh make update_ontology` (and will appear in the `src/ontology/components` folder).

### Editors' version

The -edit version, [src/ontology/VFB_scRNAseq-edit.owl](src/ontology/VFB_scRNAseq-edit.owl), is autogenerated and should not be manually edited.

## Contact
